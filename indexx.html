    <p>Today, we toast to the captain of my heart and the pilot of our adventures. Another year has gone by, another year to celebrate the amazing man you are.

Your understanding nature and the warmth of your care have been my guiding stars. I am awestruck by the journey you’ve navigated and how much you’ve achieved and it's a true testament to the upliftment God has in store for you. I am immensely proud of everything you've achieved, both up in the air and here on the ground with me. Your strength and kindness are the wind beneath my wings, pushing me to new heights every day.
As you add another candle to your cake, remember that my love for you is as vast as the sky you love so much. Here's to more dreams, more flights, and all the magical moments in between.

Happy Birthday, my love! May this year bring you as much happiness as you bring into my life every day.

With all my love,

[Your only baby]
